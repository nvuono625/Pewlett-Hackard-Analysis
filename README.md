# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
In the United Stated especially, the vast majority of the population looks forward to retirement. The time it takes to retire is different for everyone. Obviously the better you do financially, the earlier it is that we can retire and live a life free of work. There are the outliers who continue to work passed retirement but thats speaking for a small percent of people who actually enjoy their work. In this analysis, Pewlett Hackard is a large company that is being forced to create many job openings to counter the weight of the expected retirements coming in the future. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the total number of people retiring, determine the total in each departments, and who are eligible to particpate in the mentorship program.

## Summary
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
  - Based on the analysis, 90,398 employees will likely retire soon, that it is not a guarantee. the actual number of employees who retire is something that cannot be stated for certain.
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
  - As stated in the results above, there is a one retiree for every 59 new hires. I would say that it is possible but it would take some dedication from each retiree to be able to guide 59 new hires in the right direction.
